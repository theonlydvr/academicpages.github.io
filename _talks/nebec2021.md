## Abstract
Losing a child at a late-stage in pregnancy is one of the most significant fears for pregnant mothers and while many factors increase the risk of stillbirth one in particular can be easily adjusted: sleeping position. Research has indicated that mothers who habitually sleep on their backs in the supine position risk occluding the vena cava thereby severely reducing blood flow to their baby to a potentially fatal degree. However, the majority of this research has been retrospective without objective measures for sleeping positions. In order to enable a large scale study of the relationship between sleeping position and still birth, we have developed an adhesive sleep position sensor to track a motherâ€™s sleep throughout the night and report back analytics in the morning to the mother and her doctor via a mobile application. Leveraging a machine learning approach, medical grade adhesives, and an intuitive user interface, our sensor is easy to use, comfortable, and accurate to ensure a streamlined and rigorous research study.
