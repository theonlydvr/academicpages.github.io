## Abstract
Deep brain stimulation has proven to be effective in treating several neurological disorders, including Parkinsonâ€™s Disease, epilepsy, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Advances in device development over the last decade have enabled concurrent stimulation and recording at adjacent locations in the brain. These chronic neural recordings present an opportunity for identification of neural signatures of behaviors relevant to disease states. However, the amplitude of signals related to DBS artifacts are orders of magnitude larger than underlying neural activity. Additionally, the sampling rate of neural recordings is often low compared to the high frequency of therapeutic DBS. Here, we have developed a novel method, termed Period-based Artifact Reconstruction and Removal Method (PARRM), for removing DBS artifact from concurrent neural recordings. Our method finds the exact period of DBS stimulation, reconstructs a template for each instance of artifact taking local variation into account, and subtracts the template to reveal the underlying neural signal. Further, we validated the method via a benchtop saline experiment, and demonstrated the use of the method in human local field potential recordings during DBS therapy. In the future, effective removal of DBS artifact may lead to identification of neural signatures of neurological disorders and development of adaptive DBS.
