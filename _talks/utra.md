## Abstract
My project is part of an ongoing BRAIN Initiative-funded effort to design responsive algorithms to
treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) using Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). Currently, DBS
systems are adjusted in an “open-loop” fashion, where parameters are tuned by a clinician during
appointments spaced up to weeks or months apart. This “open-loop” paradigm is not ideal, as
stimulation parameters may not be sufficient for treating severe symptoms. A “closed-loop” system
may provide a solution by responsively varying stimulation parameters based on biomarkers
indicating symptomatic behavioral states. Specifically, my research is focused on interpreting,
processing, and removing the high amplitude, periodic artifacts contaminating local field potential
recordings during DBS. This preprocessing step allows for subsequent analysis of OCD symptoms
and identification of biomarkers using data from psychophysical tasks.
